# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
In this script you can play rock, paper, scissors against the CPU

The game is pretty simple, after running the scrpit you will need to type in rather "rock", "paper", or "scissors". After that is entered, the CPU's response will be 
randomized. Depending on the resault, you or the CPU could win. Also ties do not count as a win or a lost
